# This is a Python implementation of the paper "DPGA-QA: A Dual-Stream Physics-Guided Attention Framework for Underwater Image Quality Assessment".

### Environment
Before running, please create a suitable conda environment.
- conda env create -f environment.yaml
- conda activate ltpytorch

### Test
To test the model, first download the trained weights from [BaiduDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1q7Je2b3yK8An8-XSOhVdfA?pwd=0221).  
- run `dual_predict_dir.py`.  

### Train
To retrain the model:  
1. Download the pre-trained weights from [BaiduDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1q7Je2b3yK8An8-XSOhVdfA?pwd=0221).  
2. Prepare your own dataset and run `train.py`.  

To reproduce the entire training process:  
1. Collect sufficient real-world images from [SyreaNet](https://github.com/RockWenJJ/SyreaNet), or prepare them yourself.
2. Run `data.py` for data synthesis.  
3. Use the synthesized dataset to pretrain the model via `pretrain.py`.
4. Run `train.py`.  

### Notice
When running these codes, please replace them with your own file path according to the code prompts.  

### Acknowledgements
